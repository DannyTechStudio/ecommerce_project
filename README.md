### RetailPrime
RetailPrime is a single-vendor e-commerce REST API designed to power an online store backend. It enables customers to register, authenticate, browse products, view product details, manage their shopping cart, provide shipping information, and place orders securely. Administrator act as the store owner and can manage categories, products, inventory, and order statuses. The system enforces role-based access control, validates all operations, maintains accurate stock levels, and records order history.
